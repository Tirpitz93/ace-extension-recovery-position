# ace-extension-recovery-position
This mod add a recovery position that you can put unconscious players in to prolong their life before respawn.

This would allow team members to quickly extend the timeout for a fallen team member without leaving the fight. and with the full recovery postion performing a similar role to the turniquet, quickly extending the time available for the medic to work

_note this is currently just boiler plate with a side of hope and dreams, if you would like to help please submit pull requests._

I envisage this mod implementing two forms of the recovery position.
 
 1) the standard recovery position, when the patient is placed on their side in a postion where they are less likely to choke on their own tongue or vomit/blood, from this postion they can be further treated. (CPR/defib would remove them from this state).
 2) a quick recovery positon which the patient can be placed into without looking away from your current task and can be performed with your feet. A la  https://youtu.be/XXbaByUzKe0?t=156
 
Keys can be customized via CBA Settings. exact interface TBC probably hold a key while walking over the patient.

Time extension factors can also be changed via CBA settings.
